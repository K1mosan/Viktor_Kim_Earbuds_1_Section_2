## About
Welcome to my Earbuds Store â€“ your gateway to premium audio. Discover a symphony of sound, cutting-edge features, and style. Explore the perfect blend of technology and design to enhance your audio journey.

## Logo
I tried to make the design as simple and memorable as possible. It symbolizes the letter "e" which means the name of my brand "Evo".

## Nav Bar
On this website I have created a convenient navigation bar that facilitates and speeds up navigation on the site. When you hover the cursor over the selected section, it is highlighted, which makes it clear that you are in the right place. Also everything is perfectly designed to work on various devices.

## Footer
At the very bottom of the website there is a convenient panel with all the links that you may need to interact with the site. All links have animation and color highlighting. Works on various devices.

## Functionality
There are various animations on the website that include Ar Model (you can rotate the model using pop-up buttons to get to know my product more closely), X-ray model (here you can see all the main components that make up the headphones), Animation consisting of a variety of jpg images that together form a short scroll animation, that allows you to see the headphones with the case from all sides. I also added a number of Scroll-Driven Animations that make the website more interesting and dynamic. All the text on the site (h2 and p) begins to appear brighter and brighter as you scroll down the web page. I also added a box that flies from left to right. It can be found at the bottom of the page. In it I posted a text that recommends subscribing to social networks

## Colors
Website's color palette is a perfect blend of elegance, trust, simplicity, and sophistication. Black symbolizes elegance, blue instills trust, white exudes simplicity, and dark grey adds sophistication. Together, these colors create a visually appealing and stylish web design that appeals to a wide audience.

## Contact Form
I also thought it necessary to add a contact form with which you can contact me. The form also has functionality-if you click on one of the forms, it will open and become bigger in height.

## Problems
1.As you may have noticed, my jpg model is slightly shifted to the right side.
2.In order for the website to work for the mobile version and tablet, you need to go "inspect" mode: 
At first, I use Google Chrome.
a. refresh the page
b. slowly change the width of the website with small pauses. Only in this case the site will be susceptible to other devices. 

## Creator
This website is done by Viktor Kim, Interactive Media Design student at Fanshawe College.
